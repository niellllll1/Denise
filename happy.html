    <h1> Happy Birthday!! </h1>
    <b> Hi, Denise. How many months have been? How are you? I guess you're fine. Btw, Happy 18th Birthday Denise Jace Santiago, ay... 18th ba? sorry nakalimutan ko na kasi, but I'll never forget your birthday :>. I know you're curios who's this guy na nag send nanaman sayo ng message na puro kacornyhan ang laman, Who's this guy na bigla-bigla nalang magpaparamdam out of nowhere. Well don't mind me, I just want to greet you on your birthday. I hope you enjoy your day and just smile, because you're prettier when you're smiling :>, I know na stress kana sa acads mo and being an athlete is so stressful pero kalmahan mo lang kaya mo yan, I know you always did your best and you always did well, I'm so proud of you. Don't worry, wala na akong planong manggulo, wala akong ibang intention sa message ko na 'to, I just want to greet you and I also want to remind you na you deserve to be called pretty,because you really are :>. That's all ayoko nang mag drama dito baka umiyak ka nanaman, sorry if ang random HAHAHAHAHAH, and I hope you like my gift and sana napa smile kita kahit konti, kahit na medyo makalat pa and need pa ng maraming improvement sa pag gawa ng mga ganito. I guess you already know who I am, and I hope hindi ka magalit kasi ginawa ko nanaman to. Btw, you don't need to reply, Just keep fighting and keep chasing your dream. good luck and see you soon!! <3. </b>
